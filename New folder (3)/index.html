        <strong><u>Proteins:</u></strong>These are body building nutrients required especially for growth,repair and development. Every cell in the body contains protein. Protein is found in bone,muscle,skin,organs,blood,enzymes and hormones.The best source is animal protein, leguminous plants(beans,peas,etc) and cereals also are a cheaper substitute. The body however cannot store excess protein and the extra is either converted to fat or energy after being stripped of nitrogen or excreted. 
        Excessive proteins have been associated with acceleration of kidney disease which often complicates poorly controlled DM.
        osteoporosis and kidney stones have also been associated with incresed protein intake. Thus consumption of large portions of meat is unadvisable and those who finish half or a whole chicken at sitting are a risk of kidney and bone disease.
