          The human body is similar to that of an automobile but more efficient, more complex and more durable. It incorporates several systems which are all interrelated and all depend on one and other for maximal efficiency.
             This website's basic function is to inform individuals about ways to improve their health.</strong></bold>

                STROKE:</u>This is also known as Cerobrovascul Accident(CVA),this occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, either by a blockage or a rupture to a blood vessel. This deprives brain cells of oxygen and nutrients, 
                causing them to die and leading to potential long term disability or death
             . It is an acute brain damage manifesting with loss of consciousness,weakness of one side of the body or sudden loss of speech. Stroke usually complicates diabetes and hypertension and is thus a partly preventable condition
                through sensible nutritional choices. This complication is seen frequently in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension and dietary modifications must be included in the Management.
                 Low salt,low fat and weight reducing diets are therefore typically prescribed for most people who have suffered a stroke. Strokes and heart attacks have been linked to high cholesterol diets.<strong>Prevention focuses on managing risk factors through lifestyle changes and medical intervention</strong>

                ARTHRITIS:</u>This is an inflammation and degeneration in the joints. It is common in the middle aged and elderly who have excess weight. It causes pain and deformities that commonly occur in the elderly.
                 When not qualified it refers to osteoarthritis which typically affects the weight bearing joints of the spine,knees and ankles.
                 It can lead to great pain,deformities and disabilities of the limbs. It is commoner in the over nourished(obese) and in those who have high phosphate intake(bread,pastries,etc).
                  Attempts to reduce damage by Arthritis include dietary supplements like glucosamine and chondrotin which many believe

                <u>HYPERTENSION:</u>It is believed that hypertension, like diabetes has a lot to do with diet. Research has shown that low salt diet is associated with reduced hypertension prevelance and vice versa.
                   Foods rich in grains, fruit(which are high in potassium and low in sodium)lead to lower blood pressures over time. Over-nutrition(Overweight and obesity) is also closely related with hypertension and blood pressure has an almost linear relationship with weight.
                    So the heavier you are,the higher the blood pressure you will likely have.
             Hypertension is possibly precipitated by excessive salt intake  over the years, While gout(a medical condition that causes inflammation)has been linked to the consumption of excessive wine and protein.  
             The main cause of hpertension is simply not one reason but a combination of genetic and lifestyle factor.

           <u>DIABETES:</u>Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic(long standing) metabolic disorder in which blood sugars are abnormally high. 
           This may be due to lack of or inefectiveness of insulin(the blood glucose reducing hormone produced by the pancreas). Diabetes mellitus(DM) is diagnosed by the findings of fasting blood sugar of greater than or equal to 126mg/dL(7.0mmo1/l
            ).The diagnosis may also be made by  the findings of blood glucose taken at anytime except the fasting state of greater than or equal to 200mg/dL(11.1mmo1/L).High blood glucose often leads to passage of excess quantities of urine and excessive thirst and drinking of plenty of water daily. 
            Quite often there may also be weight loss,malaise and blurred vision but in some people there are no symptoms.
            The main cause of diabetes is the inability of the body to produce or effectively use insulin.

                                           <strong><u>Fat:</u>This is an important source of energy and it is calorie dense. It is recommended that it makes up 20-35% of the total calorie intake. It is 
                                            slowly digested and contributes to satiety. It provides 9 calories per gram hance it is more likely to lead to weight gain. The main fats in the body are divided int four:monosaturated,polyunsaturated(PUFA),Saturated and trans-fats. The unsaturated fats are healthier and prevent heart disease. These are found in olive oil,coconut
                                        oil,vegetable oils. The saturated and trans-fats include most animal fats like the fats in Turkey,Beef,Pork and Chicken. Palm oil is a healthy saturated vegetable oil. To reduce the fat content of the diet, remove the skin from chicken/turkey and avoid buying 
                                    meats which have visible fats. The softer or more liquid a fat is, the less saturated it.</strong>

                                    two types of fiber. They are water soluble and water insoluble fiber. Fiber can be found in fruits,cereals(oats,apples,oranges,wheat) and vegetables
                                . These are helpful in preventing constipation and help in reducing cholesterol levels. Adequate fiber intake is 15-20 grams per 1000 calories or 25-50 grams per day which can be found in two to three servings of fruits and vegetables.</strong>
